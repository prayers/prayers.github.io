 ### CHURCH vision
 The chruch is a people created by God in Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, called and sent to bear witness to God's creative, redeeming, and sanctifying activity in the world.  
 To participate in God's mission, the congregation as a part of the Church Shall:
 + Worship God in proclamation of the Word and administration of the sacraments and through lives of prayer, praise, thanksgiving, witness, and service.
 + Proclaim God's saving Gospel of justification by grace for Christ's sake through faith alone, according to the apostolic witness in the Holy Scripture, preserving and transmitting the Gospel faithfully to future generation.
 + Carry out Christ's Great Commission by reaching out to all people to bring them to faith in Christ and by doing all ministry with a global awareness consistent with the understanding of God as Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier of all.
 #### Statement of Faith
 * __God__ in the triune, everlasting God, Creator of heaven and earth and everything therein.
 * __Scripture__ that the Old and New Testaments of the Bible are wholly the Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit, and written by human hands.
 * __Man&Sin__ that man is created in the image of God, and that our first parents, having been tempted by Satan, rebelled against God, and have sinned and fallen; because of this the whole human race has been sin-stricken and has thus lost its spiritual life.
 * __Jesus Christ__ that the Lord Jesus Christ was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of the Virgin Mary, and bled and died for the sins of all men, crucified as a random upon the cross; He was buried in the grave, rose up from the dead on the third day, ascended to heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, having finished the marvelous work of redemption.
 * __Holy Spirit__ that the Holy Spirit has descended to convince men of their sin, so that they could repent and be born again.
 * __Salvation__ that man is justified by faith in Jesus, saved by grace, and except for this there is no way of salvation.
 * __Second Coming__ that the Lord Jesus Christ will come to this earth again at the end of time to judge in righteousness the living and the dead, and those who believe in the Lord will resurrect to gain eternal life, whereas those who do not believe will suffer eternal punishment.
