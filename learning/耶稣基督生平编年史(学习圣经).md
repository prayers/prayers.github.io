# 耶稣生平编年史

## 1 基督早期生活-Ⅰ

### 1.1  路加福音的序言、题词和约翰福音的引言 (Luke 1:1-4; John 1:1-18) 

#### 1. 创世之初耶稣在哪？
***
``` 
**约翰福音1:1**太初有道，道与　神同在，道就是　神。2这道太初与　神同在。
```
***
```
**约翰福音8:58**耶稣说：“我实实在在地告诉你们：还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。”
```


    **提后1:9**　神救了我们，以圣召召我们，不是按我们的行为，乃是按他的旨意和恩典。这恩典是万古之先在基督耶稣里赐给我们的。

    **约翰福音17:5**父啊，现在求你使我同你享荣耀，就是未有世界以先我同你所有的荣耀。

    **约翰福音6:62**倘或你们看见人子升到他原来所在之处，怎么样呢？

**腓立比书2:6**他本有　神的形像，不以自己与　神同等为强夺的，


#### 2. 耶稣在神创世时的工作?

**创世记1:3**　神说：“要有光”，就有了光。

**约翰福音1:3**万物是藉着他造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着他造的。

**希伯来书1:3**他是　神荣耀所发的光辉，是　神本体的真像，常用他权能的命令托住万有。他洗净了人的罪，就坐在高天至大者的右边。

**希伯来书1:10**又说：“主啊，你起初立了地的根基，天也是你手所造的。

**启示录3:14**“你要写信给老底嘉教会的使者说，那为阿们的，为诚信真实见证的，在　神创造万物之上为元首的，说：

**诗篇33:6**诸天藉耶和华的命而造，万象藉他口中的气而成。

**诗篇33:9**因为他说有，就有；命立，就立。

**以赛亚书55:11**我口所出的话也必如此，决不徒然返回，却要成就我所喜悦的，在我发他去成就的事上（“发他去成就”或作“所命定”）必然亨通。

**箴言8:30**那时，我在他那里为工师，日日为他所喜爱，常常在他面前踊跃，

**歌罗西书1:15**爱子是那不能看见之　神的像，是首生的，在一切被造的以先。

**林前8:6**然而我们只有一位神，就是父，万物都本于他，我们也归于他；并有一位主，就是耶稣基督，万物都是藉着他有的，我们也是藉着他有的。

#### 3. 神差施洗约翰的目的是什么?

**约翰福音1:6**有一个人，是从　神那里差来的，名叫约翰。7这人来，为要作见证，就是为光作见证，叫众人因他可以信。8他不是那光，乃是要为光作见证。

**路加福音1:16**他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的　神。17他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”

**路加福音1:76**孩子啊，你要称为至高者的先知；因为你要行在主的前面，预备他的道路，77叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知道救恩；

**玛拉基书3:1**万军之耶和华说：“我要差遣我的使者在我前面预备道路。你们所寻求的主，必忽然进入他的殿；立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，快要来到。”

**玛拉基书4:5**“看哪，耶和华大而可畏之日未到以前，我必差遣先知以利亚到你们那里去。6他必使父亲的心转向儿女，儿女的心转向父亲，免得我来咒诅遍地。”

#### 4. 【约一10】中指的是谁？为什么这么形容他?

『世界』在约翰的著作中具有独特的意思，指混乱、堕落的世界；『不认识』乃是不能分辨，蒙昧无知；人的心眼因为被世界的神弄瞎了，所以不能认识基督(参林后四4)。

(一)世人对真神似知不知，他们对神的认识只在暗中摸索，只靠想象猜测，缺乏绝对的把握，才会错认假神为真神(参徒十七22~24；罗一21~25)。

(二)基督徒理应认识基督，但许多信徒对主的认识相当浮浅。



**林后4:4**此等不信之人被这世界的神弄瞎了心眼，不叫基督荣耀福音的光照着他们。基督本是　神的像。

**使徒行传17:22**保罗站在亚略巴古当中，说：“众位雅典人哪，我看你们凡事很敬畏鬼神。23我游行的时候，观看你们所敬拜的，遇见一座坛，上面写着‘未识之神’。你们所不认识而敬拜的，我现在告诉你们：24创造宇宙和其中万物的　神，既是天地的主，就不住人手所造的殿，

**罗马书1:21**因为，他们虽然知道　神，却不当作　神荣耀他，也不感谢他。他们的思念变为虚妄，无知的心就昏暗了。22自称为聪明，反成了愚拙；23将不能朽坏之　神的荣耀变为偶像，仿佛必朽坏的人和飞禽、走兽、昆虫的样式。24所以，　神任凭他们逞着心里的情欲行污秽的事，以致彼此玷辱自己的身体。25他们将　神的真实变为虚谎，去敬拜侍奉受造之物，不敬奉那造物的主。主乃是可称颂的，直到永远。阿们！

#### 5. 【约一12】中耶稣会给“接待祂的”人什么？意味着什么？

「凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人」：『信』字指『信入』；本节表示相信意即接受。『名』代表整个人(参摩五8，27；赛四十八9；诗一百十三1；约十五21；十七26；徒四12)，所以『信祂名』意指接受耶稣基督。

「祂就赐他们权柄」：『权柄』在此指特别的恩典；含有确据、可倚托、靠得住之意。

「作神的儿女」：就是人有了神的生命和性情。人并非生来就是神的儿女，惟有借着接待基督，才能获得作神的儿女的权利。



**阿摩司书5:8**要寻求那造昴星和参星，使死荫变为晨光，使白日变为黑夜，命海水来浇在地上的（耶和华是他的名）。

**阿摩司书5:27**所以我要把你们掳到大马士革以外。”这是耶和华名为万军之　神说的。

**以赛亚书48:9**“我为我的名暂且忍怒，为我的颂赞向你容忍，不将你剪除。

**诗篇113:1**你们要赞美耶和华！耶和华的仆人哪，你们要赞美，赞美耶和华的名。

**约翰福音15:21**但他们因我的名要向你们行这一切的事，因为他们不认识那差我来的。

**【约17:26】**我已将你的名指示他们，还要指示他们，使你所爱我的爱在他们里面，我也在他们里面。”

**【徒4:12】**除他以外，别无拯救。因为在天下人间，没有赐下别的名，我们可以靠着得救。”

#### 6. 施洗约翰如何将自己和耶稣对比?

【太3:11】我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配，他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。

【约一15】「约翰为祂作见证，喊着说：『这就是我曾说：“那在我以后来的，反成了在我以前的。”因祂本来在我以前。』」

【可1:7】他传道说：“有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带也是不配的。
【可1:8】我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。”

【路3:16】约翰说：“我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。

【约3:30】他必兴旺，我必衰微。”

【太3:14】约翰想要拦住他，说：“我当受你的洗，你反倒上我这里来吗？”

【约5:35】约翰是点着的明灯，你们情愿暂时喜欢他的光。
【约5:36】但我有比约翰更大的见证，因为父交给我要我成就的事，就是我所作的事，这便见证我是父所差来的。

【太11:11】我实在告诉你们：凡妇人所生的，没有一个兴起来大过施洗约翰的；然而天国里最小的比他还大。

#### 7. In contrast to the law given through Moses, what is said to have come through Jesus Christ? Give a brief summary of how this is true.

【约1:17】律法本是藉着摩西传的，恩典和真理都是由耶稣基督来的。

在西乃山,显现在荣光之中的神藉著摩西将律法赐给了人。但凡有血气的没有一个因行律法能在神面前称义([罗3:20](about:blank#b))唯有藉着中保基督的恩典才能得救([弗2:8](about:blank#b))。

**罗3:20** 所以凡有血气的，没有一个因行律法能在　神面前称义，因为律法本是叫人知罪。

**弗2:8** 你们得救是本乎恩，也因着信；这并不是出于自己，乃是　神所赐的；

### 1.2  耶稣家谱 (Matthew 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38) 

#### 8. How many generations were there from Abraham to Christ?

【太1:17】这样，从亚伯拉罕到大卫共有十四代，从大卫到迁至巴比伦的时候也有十四代，从迁至巴比伦的时候到基督又有十四代。

#### 9. According to Luke, of whom is Jesus "supposed" to be the son? Why did he express it in that way?

【路3:23】[和合本]耶稣开头传道，年纪约有三十岁。依人看来，他是约瑟的儿子，约瑟是希里的儿子，
[ASV]And Jesus himself, when he began to teach , was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,

①再次强调耶稣是神的儿子;②表明耶稣是亚当的子孙,他与整个人类有关系。路加试图通过耶稣的家谱,证明耶稣就是弥赛亚,要拯救在始祖亚当里,面临必死命运的全人类([林前15:21,22](about:blank#b))。

**林前15:21** 死既是因一人而来，死人复活也是因一人而来。
**林前15:22** 在亚当里众人都死了，照样，在基督里众人也都要复活。

#### 10. 如何解释马太福音和路加福音记载的耶稣家谱的区别?

路加福音中的家谱则追溯耶稣是大卫直系的儿子。马太福音的家谱是按大卫王的王位写的，即由他的儿子、第二位王所罗门一个接一个地叙述；而路加福音的家谱，则按血缘关系写的，即由他另外一个儿子拿单，一代一代地叙述。前者以约瑟从神领受儿子耶稣作结，后者追溯马利亚的祖宗，见证耶稣是她真正的儿子。

### 1.3  Annunciation to Zacharias of the Birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5-25) 

【路1:13】天使对他说：“撒迦利亚，不要害怕，因为你的祈祷已经被听见了。你的妻子伊利莎白要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。
【路1:14】你必欢喜快乐，有许多人因他出世也必喜乐。
【路1:15】他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。
【路1:16】他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的　神。
【路1:17】他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”

【路1:18】撒迦利亚对天使说：“我凭着什么可知道这事呢？我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。”
【路1:19】天使回答说：“我是站在　神面前的加百列，奉差而来对你说话，将这好信息报给你。
【路1:20】到了时候，这话必然应验。只因你不信，你必哑巴不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。”

#### 11. Who were Zacharias and Elizabeth? Describe their character.

【路1:5】当犹太王希律的时候，亚比雅班里有一个祭司，名叫撒迦利亚。他妻子是亚伦的后人，名叫伊利莎白。
【路1:6】他们二人在　神面前都是义人，遵行主的一切诫命礼仪，没有可指摘的。
【路1:7】只是没有孩子，因为伊利莎白不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。

撒迦利亚（意思是主记念）是一个祭司，属亚比雅的班次，是二十四个班次其中之一；这犹太祭司职务的班次是当年大所分派的（代上二四10）。每个班次都要在耶路撒冷的圣殿执行祭司的职务，一年两次，从安息日到安息日。当时祭司的数目很多，若有机会进入主的圣殿，执行烧香的特权，一生也只得一次。

以利沙伯（意思是神的誓约）是祭司家族亚伦的后人。她和丈夫都是虔诚的犹太人，一丝不苟地遵行旧约圣经一切的诫命和礼仪。当然，并不是说他们无罪，而是当他们犯了罪，就必定献祭或遵行其他规定的仪式。

夫妇没有孩子，这是任何犹太人引以为耻的事实。路加医生注意到原因是以利沙伯不能生育。因为两个人又年纪老迈，所以问题更加严重。

撒迦利亚因为不信，便失去了说话的能力，直到孩子出生为止。每当一个信徒对神的话怀有不信，就会失去见证和歌声；不信令信徒三缄其口，直至他恢复信心，才会再次发出赞美和见证。

以利沙伯怀孕后，在家中隐居了五个月；她感到欢喜快乐，因为主要把她因没有孩子而带来的羞耻除去。

#### 12. What was Zacharias doing at the time the an gel appeared to him and revealed that Elizabeth would bear a son?

【路1:8】撒迦利亚按班次，在　神面前供祭司的职分。
【路1:9】照祭司的规矩掣签，得进主殿烧香。
【路1:10】烧香的时候，众百姓在外面祷告。
【路1:11】有主的使者站在香坛的右边向他显现。

#### 13. What did the angel tell Zacharias in reference to the son that was to be born to him and his wife?

【路1:13】天使对他说：“撒迦利亚，不要害怕，因为你的祈祷已经被听见了。你的妻子伊利莎白要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。
【路1:14】你必欢喜快乐，有许多人因他出世也必喜乐。
【路1:15】他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。
【路1:16】他要使许多以色列人回转，归于主他们的　神。
【路1:17】他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧，又为主预备合用的百姓。”

#### 14. When Zacharias asked for proof from the angel to verify his message, what sign did he give him?

【路1:18】撒迦利亚对天使说：“我凭着什么可知道这事呢？我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。”
【路1:19】天使回答说：“我是站在　神面前的加百列，奉差而来对你说话，将这好信息报给你。
【路1:20】到了时候，这话必然应验。只因你不信，你必哑巴不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。”

### 1.4  Annunciation of the Birth of Jesus (Matthew 1:18-25; Luke 1:26-38) 

#### 15. When Joseph learned that Mary was to have a child, what was he going to do? Why? In response to this, who appeared to Joseph? What did he reveal?

【太1:18】耶稣基督降生的事记在下面：他母亲马利亚已经许配了约瑟，还没有迎娶，马利亚就从圣灵怀了孕。
【太1:19】她丈夫约瑟是个义人，不愿意明明地羞辱她，想要暗暗地把她休了。
【太1:20】正思念这事的时候，有主的使者向他梦中显现，说：“大卫的子孙约瑟，不要怕，只管娶过你的妻子马利亚来，因她所怀的孕是从圣灵来的。
【太1:21】她将要生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。”
【太1:22】这一切的事成就，是要应验主藉先知所说的话，
【太1:23】说：“必有童女怀孕生子，人要称他的名为以马内利。”（“以马内利”翻出来就是“　神与我们同在”。）
【太1:24】约瑟醒了，起来，就遵着主使者的吩咐，把妻子娶过来，
【太1:25】只是没有和她同房，等她生了儿子（有古卷作“等她生了头胎的儿子”），就给他起名叫耶稣。

#### 16. What prophecies were fulfilled by the birth of Jesus?

【太1:22】这一切的事成就，是要应验主藉先知所说的话，
【太1:23】说：“必有童女怀孕生子，人要称他的名为以马内利。”（“以马内利”翻出来就是“　神与我们同在”。）

**赛7:14** 因此，主自己要给你们一个兆头，必有童女怀孕生子，给他起名叫以马内利（就是“　神与我们同在”的意思）。

#### 17. Whose throne did the angel tell Mary that her Son would occupy? Why could He do that?

【路1:28】天使进去，对她说：“蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了！”
【路1:29】马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。
【路1:30】天使对她说：“马利亚，不要怕！你在　神面前已经蒙恩了。
【路1:31】你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。

【路1:32】他要为大，称为至高者的儿子，主　神要把他祖大卫的位给他。
【路1:33】他要作雅各家的王，直到永远，他的国也没有穷尽。”

#### 18. What did Mary ask the angel after being told she was to bear a son? What was his response?

【路1:34】马利亚对天使说：“我没有出嫁，怎么有这事呢？”

【路1:35】天使回答说：“圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你，因此所要生的圣者，必称为　神的儿子（或作“所要生的必称为圣，称为　神的儿子”）。
【路1:36】况且你的亲戚伊利莎白，在年老的时候也怀了男胎，就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。
【路1:37】因为出于　神的话，没有一句不带能力的。”

### 1.5  Mary's Visit to Elizabeth (Luke 1:39-56) 

#### 19. What was Mary's relationship to Elizabeth? What caused Mary to visit her at this time?

圣经没有说明为什么当时马利亚去探访以利沙伯，也许是要避开当她怀孕的消息传开后，无可避免地在拿撒勒出现的丑闻。如果真是这样，那么以利沙伯所表现的欢迎和仁慈就加倍温馨了。

马利亚去见伊利莎白，一方面要证实天使的话──不生育的竟然怀孕六个月了；一方面要将自己的经历告诉她。这两位没有想过会在这么奇妙的情况下作母亲的表姊妹，互相分享各自的感觉和喜乐，并谈论神奇妙的作为。结果，她们同被圣灵感动，二人就一同歌颂赞美神。

#### 20. What happened when Mary greeted Elizabeth? Why?

【路1:41】伊利莎白一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动，伊利莎白且被圣灵充满，
【路1:42】高声喊着说：“你在妇女中是有福的，你所怀的胎也是有福的。
【路1:43】我主的母到我这里来，这是从哪里得的呢？
【路1:44】因为你问安的声音一入我耳，我腹里的胎就欢喜跳动。
【路1:45】这相信的女子是有福的，因为主对她所说的话都要应验。”

伊利莎白被圣灵充满说:①怀耶稣基督的马利亚是妇女中最有福的;②马利亚所怀的耶稣基督是弥赛亚;③自己腹中的胎儿施洗约翰也赞同这一点。路加通过间接比较施洗约翰和耶稣基督,强调施洗约翰是预备耶稣道路的先锋,耶稣是走那道路的弥赛亚([3:3-6;约1:19-27](about:blank#b))。而犹太人不懂这一事实,反而排斥耶稣(4:23-30)。甚至把耶稣钉死在十字架上(23:21-25)。表现出犹太人属灵的无知(19:41-44)。

### 1.6  The Birth and Early Life of John the Baptist (Luke 1:57-80) 

#### 21. Briefly summarize the events surrounding the birth of John the Baptist.

【路1:57】伊利莎白的产期到了，就生了一个儿子。
【路1:58】邻里亲族听见主向她大施怜悯，就和她一同欢乐。
【路1:59】到了第八日，他们来要给孩子行割礼，并要照他父亲的名字，叫他撒迦利亚。
【路1:60】他母亲说：“不可，要叫他约翰。”
【路1:61】他们说：“你亲族中没有叫这名字的。”
【路1:62】他们就向他父亲打手势，问他要叫这孩子什么名字。
【路1:63】他要了一块写字的板，就写上说：“他的名字是约翰。”他们便都希奇。
【路1:64】撒迦利亚的口立时开了，舌头也舒展了，就说出话来，称颂　神。
【路1:65】周围居住的人都惧怕。这一切的事就传遍了犹太的山地。
【路1:66】凡听见的人都将这事放在心里，说：“这个孩子将来怎么样呢？”因为有主与他同在。

#### 22. What did Zacharias say that John would do?

【路1:67】他父亲撒迦利亚被圣灵充满了，就预言说：
【路1:68】“主以色列的　神是应当称颂的，因他眷顾他的百姓，为他们施行救赎。
【路1:69】在他仆人大卫家中，为我们兴起了拯救的角，
【路1:70】正如主藉着从创世以来，圣先知的口所说的话，
【路1:71】拯救我们脱离仇敌和一切恨我们之人的手；
【路1:72】向我们列祖施怜悯，记念他的圣约，
【路1:73】就是他对我们祖宗亚伯拉罕所起的誓，
【路1:74】叫我们既从仇敌手中被救出来，
【路1:75】就可以终身在他面前坦然无惧地用圣洁、公义侍奉他。
【路1:76】孩子啊，你要称为至高者的先知；因为你要行在主的前面，预备他的道路，
【路1:77】叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知道救恩；
【路1:78】因我们　神怜悯的心肠，叫清晨的日光从高天临到我们，
【路1:79】要照亮坐在黑暗中死荫里的人，把我们的脚引到平安的路上。”

#### 23. What is said of John as a child?

【路1:80】那孩子渐渐长大，心灵强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。

#### 24. What is meant by the phrase "till the day of his manifestation to Israel?"

 在主耶稣诞生前后，犹太教有一个名为『爱色尼教派』，教中人生活严谨，刻苦禁欲，隐居旷野，自食其力，故又称作『戒行派』。有些人相信施洗约翰出身此派，后来蒙神呼召出来传道，作耶稣的先锋。

本章以简单的描述作结，那孩子在身体和灵命上渐渐长大，住在旷野，直到他在以色列人中公开露面的日子。──《活石新约圣经注释》



## 2 基督早期生活-II

### 2.1  The Birth of Jesus (Luke 2:1-20) 

#### 1. Who sent out a decree requiring all people to go to their own city to be enrolled? What was the purpose of this enrollment? What is meant by the phrase "his own city?”

【路2:1】当那些日子，凯撒奥古斯都有旨意下来，叫天下人民都报名上册。
【路2:2】这是居里扭作叙利亚巡抚的时候，头一次行报名上册的事。
【路2:3】众人各归各城，报名上册。

到主后六年时，每十四年就举行一次大规模的人口普查；在那年之前似乎也有定期的调查，不过没有那么密集。备受尊崇的皇帝亚古士督（或译为「奥古斯都」）为收税而进行的人口调查，在二章1～14节成为该撒（或译为「西泽」）地上之虚华与基督天上之荣美的对比。

*虽然埃及的人口普查记录显示，进行税收的人口调查时，百姓必须回到家里，不过他们所回的家，是他们拥有财产的家，而不是出生的家（人口是按产业登记的）。因此，约瑟在伯利恒应该还有地业；如果可以用主后六年的调查作参考，他可能不需要登记加利利的产业。*

#### 2. Where was Joseph required to go as a result of this decree? Who accompanied him? Why?

【路2:4】约瑟也从加利利的拿撒勒城上犹太去，到了大卫的城，名叫伯利恒，因他本是大卫一族一家的人，
【路2:5】要和他所聘之妻马利亚一同报名上册。那时马利亚的身孕已经重了。

#### 3. In what city was Jesus born? Why was He born in a stable? What Old Testament prophecies were fulfilled by His birth?

【路2:6】他们在那里的时候，马利亚的产期到了，
【路2:7】就生了头胎的儿子，用布包起来，放在马槽里，因为客店里没有地方。

①耶稣诞生在伯利恒,应验先知弥迦关于弥赛亚的预言([弥5:2](about:blank#b));②耶稣躺在马槽里,表明他“谦卑的品性”。约瑟和马利亚的伯利恒之行,从人的角度看,是遵行政府行政指示的行为;但从救赎史的立场看,是神护理下的旅程,目的是为了成就旧约预言。

**弥5:2** 伯利恒以法他啊，你在犹大诸城中为小。将来必有一位从你那里出来，在以色列中为我作掌权的；他的根源从亘古、从太初就有。

#### 4. Who appeared to shepherds who were in the fields near Bethlehem? What was his message to them? How were they to know the Christ when they saw Him?

【路2:8】在伯利恒之野地里有牧羊的人，夜间按着更次看守羊群。
【路2:9】有主的使者站在他们旁边，主的荣光四面照着他们，牧羊的人就甚惧怕。
【路2:10】那天使对他们说：“不要惧怕，我报给你们大喜的信息，是关乎万民的。
【路2:11】因今天在大卫的城里，为你们生了救主，就是主基督。
【路2:12】你们要看见一个婴孩，包着布，卧在马槽里，那就是记号了。”

#### 5. What did the shepherds do after they had seen the baby Jesus?

【路2:15】众天使离开他们升天去了，牧羊的人彼此说：“我们往伯利恒去，看看所成的事，就是主所指示我们的。”
【路2:16】他们急忙去了，就寻见马利亚和约瑟，又有那婴孩卧在马槽里。
【路2:17】既然看见，就把天使论这孩子的话传开了。
【路2:18】凡听见的，就诧异牧羊之人对他们所说的话。

### 2.2  The Circumcision of Jesus and His Presentation in the Temple (Luke 2:21-39) 

#### 6. What was done to Jesus on the eighth day following His birth? Why?

【路2:21】满了八天，就给孩子行割礼，与他起名叫耶稣，这就是没有成胎以前，天使所起的名。

耶稣照摩西的律法行割礼([创17:12](about:blank#b))、洁净礼([利12:1-8](about:blank#b))、奉献礼([民18:15,16](about:blank#b))。耶稣亲自遵行律法,这证明:①耶稣为成全律法而来到世上,在执行事工时没有丝毫的缺陷;②为了救赎律法以下的人,自己降生在律法之下([加4:4-5](about:blank#b))。

**创17:12** 你们世世代代的男子，无论是家里生的，是在你后裔之外用银子从外人买的，生下来第八日，都要受割礼。

**利12:1** 耶和华对摩西说：
**利12:2** “你晓谕以色列人说：若有妇人怀孕生男孩，她就不洁净七天，像在月经污秽的日子不洁净一样。
**利12:3** 第八天要给婴孩行割礼。
**利12:4** 妇人在产血不洁之中，要家居三十三天。她洁净的日子未满，不可摸圣物，也不可进入圣所。
**利12:5** 她若生女孩，就不洁净两个七天，像污秽的时候一样，要在产血不洁之中，家居六十六天。
**利12:6** “满了洁净的日子，无论是为男孩，是为女孩，她要把一岁的羊羔为燔祭，一只雏鸽或是一只斑鸠为赎罪祭，带到会幕门口交给祭司。
**利12:7** 祭司要献在耶和华面前，为她赎罪，她的血源就洁净了。这条例是为生育的妇人，无论是生男生女。
**利12:8** 她的力量若不够献一只羊羔，她就要取两只斑鸠或是两只雏鸽，一只为燔祭，一只为赎罪祭。祭司要为她赎罪，她就洁净了。”

**民18:15** 他们所有奉给耶和华的，连人带牲畜，凡头生的都要归给你；只是人头生的，总要赎出来；不洁净牲畜头生的，也要赎出来。
**民18:16** 其中在一月之外所当赎的，要照你所估定的价，按圣所的平，用银子五舍客勒赎出来（一舍客勒是二十季拉）。

**加4:4** 及至时候满足，　神就差遣他的儿子，为女子所生，且生在律法以下，
**加4:5** 要把律法以下的人赎出来，叫我们得着儿子的名分。

#### 7. When was Jesus taken to the temple in Jerusalem? What was the purpose of this visit?

【路2:22】按摩西律法满了洁净的日子，他们带着孩子上耶路撒冷去，要把他献与主。
【路2:23】（正如主的律法上所记：“凡头生的男子必称圣归主。”）
【路2:24】又要照主的律法上所说，或用一对斑鸠，或用两只雏鸽献祭。

产妇须执行的洁净规例。若生男孩,不洁33天;若生女孩,不洁66天([利12:4-5](about:blank#b))。期限满时,献燔祭和赎罪祭作为“洁净礼”。要在圣殿中举行洁净仪式,马利亚为了守规例上到耶路撒冷。

#### 8. Who was Simeon? What had the Holy Spirit revealed to him? What did he do and say in relation to Jesus, Mary, and Joseph?

【路2:25】在耶路撒冷有一个人名叫西面。这人又公义又虔诚，素常盼望以色列的安慰者来到，又有圣灵在他身上。
【路2:26】他得了圣灵的启示，知道自己未死以前，必看见主所立的基督。
【路2:27】他受了圣灵的感动，进入圣殿，正遇见耶稣的父母抱着孩子进来，要照律法的规矩办理。
【路2:28】西面就用手接过他来，称颂　神说：
【路2:29】“主啊，如今可以照你的话，释放仆人安然去世；
【路2:30】因为我的眼睛已经看见你的救恩，
【路2:31】就是你在万民面前所预备的，
【路2:32】是照亮外邦人的光，又是你民以色列的荣耀。”
【路2:33】孩子的父母因这论耶稣的话就希奇。
【路2:34】西面给他们祝福，又对孩子的母亲马利亚说：“这孩子被立，是要叫以色列中许多人跌倒，许多人兴起；又要作毁谤的话柄，叫许多人心里的意念显露出来；你自己的心也要被刀刺透。”

#### 9. Who was Anna? What did she do in relation to Jesus?

【路2:36】又有女先知名叫亚拿，是亚设支派法内力的女儿，年纪已经老迈，从作童女出嫁的时候，同丈夫住了七年，就寡居了。
【路2:37】现在已经八十四岁（或作“就寡居了八十四年”），并不离开圣殿，禁食祈求，昼夜侍奉　神。
【路2:38】正当那时，她进前来称谢　神，将孩子的事对一切盼望耶路撒冷得救赎的人讲说。

### 2.3  The Visit of the Wise Men from the East (Matthew 2:1-12) 

#### 10. Why did the wise men come to Jerusalem?

【太2:1】当希律王的时候，耶稣生在犹太的伯利恒。有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷，说：
【太2:2】“那生下来作犹太人之王的在哪里？我们在东方看见他的星，特来拜他。”

#### 11. Who was Herod? Why was he troubled over the visit of the wise men? What request did he make of them?

【太2:3】希律王听见了，就心里不安；耶路撒冷合城的人也都不安。
【太2:4】他就召齐了祭司长和民间的文士，问他们说：“基督当生在何处？”
【太2:5】他们回答说：“在犹太的伯利恒。因为有先知记着，说：
【太2:6】‘犹大地的伯利恒啊，你在犹大诸城中并不是最小的，因为将来有一位君王要从你那里出来，牧养我以色列民。’”
【太2:7】当下希律暗暗地召了博士来，细问那星是什么时候出现的，
【太2:8】就差他们往伯利恒去，说：“你们去仔细寻访那小孩子，寻到了，就来报信，我也好去拜他。”

希律王并非犹太人,而是以土买人(Idumean)。B.C.40,希律(Herod,the great)以钱财贿赂了由尤里乌斯.凯撒（Julius Caesar）领导的罗马帝国元老会议,因而被封为犹太王,统治了犹大37年。他先后残酷地杀死了自己的妻子、三个儿子、岳母、姐夫、叔父及其他许多人,还不问是非曲折屠杀了伯利恒城的男婴(16节)。虽然如此,他在位期间也留下了许多伟绩,如建造各种剧场、圆型竞技场、各种纪念碑、异教祭坛、城堡等建筑物。更是从B.C.20年开始重建耶路撒冷圣殿的工程,此工程在他死后的A.D.68年才竣工<斯3:8-13,耶路撒冷圣殿的历史>。

听到弥赛亚降生的消息之后,希律是因自己的王权而不安,一般民众是因自己的处境受到极大的冲击而不安。

**2:7,8 我也好去拜他:** 希律的这句话表露了试图以残酷的手段维护自我利益的丑态。对希律而言,自己的地位优先于公义与良心。

#### 12. How did the wise men finally find Jesus? What gifts did they bring Him? Why did they not comply with Herod's request? What did they do instead?

【太2:9】他们听见王的话就去了。在东方所看见的那星，忽然在他们前头行，直行到小孩子的地方，就在上头停住了。
【太2:10】他们看见那星，就大大地欢喜，
【太2:11】进了房子，看见小孩子和他母亲马利亚，就俯伏拜那小孩子，揭开宝盒，拿黄金、乳香、没药为礼物献给他。
【太2:12】博士因为在梦中被主指示不要回去见希律，就从别的路回本地去了。

### 2.4  The Flight into Egypt and the Subsequent Return to Nazareth (Matthew 2:13-23; Luke 2:39) 

#### 13. What advice did the angel of the Lord give Joseph when he appeared to him soon after the departure of the wise men? What did Joseph do?

【太2:13】他们去后，有主的使者向约瑟梦中显现，说：“起来！带着小孩子同他母亲逃往埃及，住在那里，等我吩咐你，因为希律必寻找小孩子，要除灭他。”
【太2:14】约瑟就起来，夜间带着小孩子和他母亲往埃及去，

#### 14. What prophecy was fulfilled when Joseph took the child Jesus into Egypt?

【太2:15】住在那里，直到希律死了。这是要应验主藉先知所说的话，说：“我从埃及召出我的儿子来。”

**[出4:22](about:blank#b)** 你要对法老说：‘耶和华这样说：以色列是我的儿子，我的长子。
**[民24:8](about:blank#b)** 　神领他出埃及，他似乎有野牛之力。他要吞吃敌国，折断他们的骨头，用箭射透他们。
**[何11:1](about:blank#b)** “以色列年幼的时候我爱他，就从埃及召出我的儿子来。

#### 15. How did Joseph learn of the death of Herod? What did he do upon hearing of it?

【太2:19】希律死了以后，有主的使者在埃及向约瑟梦中显现，说：
【太2:20】“起来！带着小孩子和他母亲往以色列地去，因为要害小孩子性命的人已经死了。”
【太2:21】约瑟就起来，把小孩子和他母亲带到以色列地去，

#### 16. To what city did Joseph return with Mary and the child? Why? What prophecy was fulfilled by this action?

【太2:22】只因听见亚基老接着他父亲希律作了犹太王，就怕往那里去，又在梦中被主指示，便往加利利境内去了。
【太2:23】到了一座城，名叫拿撒勒，就住在那里。这是要应验先知所说，他将称为拿撒勒人的话了。

许多解经家对「祂将称为拿撒勒人」有如下两种解释：

1.「拿撒勒人」与希伯来文『拿细耳人』(民六2)一字的发音相近，或指祂是真正分别为圣的拿细耳人(约十七19)。

2.与希伯来文『一条』(赛十一1)相似，指祂是从耶西残株上抽出的一条嫩芽。

旧约里面从未提及「拿撒勒」，而本节的「先知」在原文是复数词，故最合理的解释应当是指应验众先知所说有关弥赛亚豫言的隐意──祂在世时会『被人藐视』(诗廿二6；赛四十九7；五十三3)，而作一个加利利的「拿撒勒人」，乃是被一般犹太人所藐视的(参约一46；七41，52)。

**[民6:13](about:blank#b)** “拿细耳人满了离俗的日子乃有这条例：人要领他到会幕门口，
**[士13:5](about:blank#b)** 你必怀孕生一个儿子，不可用剃头刀剃他的头，因为这孩子一出胎就归　神作拿细耳人。他必起首拯救以色列人脱离非利士人的手。”
**[撒上1:11](about:blank#b)** 许愿说：“万军之耶和华啊，你若垂顾婢女的苦情，眷念不忘婢女，赐我一个儿子，我必使他终身归与耶和华，不用剃头刀剃他的头。”
**[诗69:9,10](about:blank#b)** 因我为你的殿心里焦急，如同火烧，并且辱骂你人的辱骂都落在我身上。我哭泣，以禁食刻苦我心，这倒算为我的羞辱。
**[赛53:1,2](about:blank#b)** 我们所传的（或作“所传与我们的”）有谁信呢？耶和华的膀臂向谁显露呢？他在耶和华面前生长如嫩芽，像根出于干地。他无佳形美容，我们看见他的时候，也无美貌使我们羡慕他。

**[摩2:10-12](about:blank#b)** 我也将你们从埃及地领上来，在旷野引导你们四十年，使你们得亚摩利人之地为业。我从你们子弟中兴起先知，又从你们少年人中兴起拿细耳人。以色列人哪，不是这样吗？”这是耶和华说的。“你们却给拿细耳人酒喝，嘱咐先知说：‘不要说预言。

### 2.5  Jesus' Visit to Jerusalem at Age Twelve (Luke 2:40-52) 

#### 17. Why did Jesus accompany His parents to Jerusalem?

【路2:41】每年到逾越节，他父母就上耶路撒冷去。
【路2:42】当他十二岁的时候，他们按着节期的规矩上去。

按照摩西律法的规定，犹太人每年须在逾越、五旬、住棚三个大节日，上耶路撒冷城过节(参申十六16)；但到了耶稣降生的年代，住在远处的犹太人，只在逾越节上去过节。

「逾越节」：这是记念以色列人被拯救出埃及的节期(参出十二1~20)，在犹太历的正月里(约合阳历三至四月间)举行，为期七天。

据解经家阿福德(Alford)说，犹太人称年满十二岁的男孩为『律法之子』，须开始受律法的约束。

又有人说，犹太人男孩年满十三岁，即正式成为以色列圣会的一员，一般人于『十二岁』起，即开始作准备工夫。

#### 18. After setting out for home on their return journey, what did Mary and Joseph discover? How long did it take them to find Jesus? Where was He when they found Him? What was He doing?

【路2:43】守满了节期，他们回去，孩童耶稣仍旧在耶路撒冷。他的父母并不知道，
【路2:44】以为他在同行的人中间，走了一天的路程，就在亲族和熟识的人中找他。
【路2:45】既找不着，就回耶路撒冷去找他。
【路2:46】过了三天，就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。
【路2:47】凡听见他的，都希奇他的聪明和他的应对。

#### 19. What did Mary ask Jesus upon finding Him? What was His reply?

【路2:48】他父母看见就很希奇。他母亲对他说：“我儿，为什么向我们这样行呢？看哪，你父亲和我伤心来找你。”
【路2:49】耶稣说：“为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗（或作“岂不知我应当在我父的家里吗”）？”

信徒身为神的儿女，应当以天父的事为念，而不要以地上的事为念(参西三2)。

#### 20. Describe the development of Jesus in the following areas and what is involved in each area.

a. Wisdom.

b. Stature.

c. In favor with God.

d. In favor with men.

 



## 3 施洗约翰的早期事奉和耶稣的受洗与试探

【太3:5】那时，耶路撒冷和犹太全地，并约旦河一带地方的人，都出去到约翰那里，
【太3:6】承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。
【太3:11】我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配，他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。

【可1:4】照这话，约翰来了，在旷野施洗，传悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。
【可1:5】犹太全地和耶路撒冷的人都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。

【路3:3】他就来到约旦河一带地方，宣讲悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。

#### 4. How did the Jews react to John's preaching and baptizing? Give evidence to support your answer.

【路3:7】约翰对那出来要受他洗的众人说：“毒蛇的种类！谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢？
【路3:12】又有税吏来要受洗，问他说：“夫子，我们当作什么呢？”
【路3:15】百姓指望基督来的时候，人都心里猜疑，或者约翰是基督。
【路3:18】约翰又用许多别的话劝百姓，向他们传福音。

【可1:5】犹太全地和耶路撒冷的人都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。

【太3:5】那时，耶路撒冷和犹太全地，并约旦河一带地方的人，都出去到约翰那里，
【太3:6】承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。

#### 5. What did John say to the Scribes and Pharisees who came to be baptized by him? Why?

【太3:7】约翰看见许多法利赛人和撒都该人也来受洗，就对他们说：“毒蛇的种类！谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢？
【太3:8】你们要结出果子来，与悔改的心相称。
【太3:9】不要自己心里说：‘有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。’我告诉你们：　神能从这些石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。
【太3:10】现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。
【太3:11】我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配，他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
【太3:12】他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。”

【路3:7】约翰对那出来要受他洗的众人说：“毒蛇的种类！谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢？
【路3:8】你们要结出果子来，与悔改的心相称，不要自己心里说：‘有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。’我告诉你们：　神能从这些石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。
【路3:9】现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。”
【路3:16】约翰说：“我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
【路3:17】他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。”

#### 6. What was John referring to when he said, "And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees?"

**太7:19** 凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。
**约15:2** 凡属我不结果子的枝子，他就剪去；凡结果子的，他就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多。

【路3:9】现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树就砍下来，丢在火里。”

「现在斧子已经放在树根上」：喻指随时会把树砍下来，藉以警告时日无多，要把握机会悔改。

(一)甚么样的树(生命)，结出甚么样的果子(行为)；好树不能结坏果子，坏树不能结好果子(太七18)。

(二)凡从天然生命这棵树上长出来的，没有一件事能蒙神的悦纳，都要连根砍掉；外邦人因为『与神所赐的生命隔绝了』，所以才会『贪行种种的污秽』(弗四17~19)。

 (三)凡不能把基督(「好果子」)表现出来的，在永世里都要失去价值。

#### 7. How did John compare himself to the Christ?

【路3:16】约翰说：“我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。

**太3:11** 我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配，他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
**约1:26** 约翰回答说：“我是用水施洗，但有一位站在你们中间，是你们不认识的，
**徒1:5** 约翰是用水施洗，但不多几日，你们要受圣灵的洗。”

#### 8. What did John say the Christ would do when He came? How and when would that be done?

【路3:16】约翰说：“我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
【路3:17】他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。”

【可1:7】他传道说：“有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带也是不配的。
【可1:8】我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。”

【太3:11】我是用水给你们施洗，叫你们悔改；但那在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是给他提鞋也不配，他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。
【太3:12】他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。”

1.对于真实悔改相信祂的人，祂要用圣灵给他们施浸，就是把他们浸到圣灵里，使他们得着神的生命，成为基督的身体──教会(林前十二13；徒二2~4)。

2.对于不肯悔改信主的人，和挂名的基督徒，祂要用火给他们施浸，就是火的审判(启廿15)。
