An Online Spiritual Gifts Inventory

Instructions:

This inventory contains 125 questions and will take 20-45 miuntes to complete, so please allow adequate time to answer all questions before beginning.

2. According to the scale below, select the response that best describes or characterizes yourself. Record your answers on the answer sheet provided. DO NOT answer according to what you think should be true, but based on actual past experience. Do not leave any answers blank.

1 – Occasionally characteristic of me/true for me–about 25% of the time.  
2 – Sometimes characteristic of me/true for me–about 50% of the time.  
3 – Usually characteristic of me/true for me–about 75% of the time.  
4 – Highly characteristic of me/definitely true for me.
