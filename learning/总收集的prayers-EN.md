But incompletely can we humans give You all thanks and worship for You are bigger than millions of tongues praises. But here we are today thanking in the little way we can for who You are and for what You do and have done. All blessing, glory, and honour to You Lord.

+ 60. In seconds there are 60, in minutes there are 60, in hours there are 24, in days there are 365 or 366, all these multiplied together by millions can’t even measure up a bit to the praise of Your wondrous works and goodness. You are greater than the heart can ever imagine. Today is a day to once again bring up our sacrifices of praise to You. Blessed be Your Name, O God of all flesh.

Definitely impossible is it for man to finish giving the praise of Yahweh for He is far far beyond what man can think of.

But it’s of a good thing to show forth our praises in the little way we can from a grateful heart because every single day e end just for a second, the breath we breathe in to stay alive is highly worth giving thanks for before any other thing.

God’s show of love and mercy is incomparable to the number of praises raised to Him. But out of His boundless love and infinite mercy Has he permitted us to give it with a pure and grateful heart.

Therefore, make it of great importance to select one or more of these prayers to appreciate God even when we know He deserves more.

It is really a good thing to praise the Lord, I believe you know that, right?

"Whatever the issue in your life is, the key is to worship a holy God who created you and knows everything about you - your failures, shortcomings, insecurities[ Insecurities	[ˌɪnsɪˈkjʊərɪtɪz] n.  不安全( insecurity的名词复数 ); 不牢靠; 局促不安; 无把握;], besetting[ Besetting	[bɪ'setɪŋ] 	adj.  不断攻击的; v.  困扰( beset的现在分词); 不断围攻; 镶; 嵌] sins and fears.

I can tell you how to get untangled[ Untangle	 [ʌnˈtæŋɡəl]	vt.  解开（某物的）结; 使不再打结; 整顿; 解决（纠纷等）;] from the snares[ Snare		[sner]	n.  陷阱，罗网; 诱惑; vt.  捕捉; 诱惑; 安圈套; 陷害;] in your path and how to move forward.

Chuck Pierce with John Dickson 

**There is power in worshiping God. **
If we want to see breakthroughs in our life and in the lives of others, then this is the time to enter into deeper levels of worship. When you and I come boldly to God's throne in worship, He gives us His plans and strategies for our lives here on earth. There is no way that we can walk in His peace, power, and perfect plan without a lifestyle of worship.   
God knows what He is doing here on earth. He can make sense of things that are happening and can show us the way through challenges. He can strengthen us in prayer and give us keys during our seasons of worship that unlock the path before us and bring glory into our situations here on earth. 
Worship changes our lives and how we see our circumstances.
