# Bible Study Plan

The Bible is an amazing book; we can’t study it enough. Keep studying, learning, and growing. We turn to the Bible to learn, and then we also turn to the Bible in difficult times for comfort and consolation. “When the world beats you down, open up your Bible,” said Lysa TerKeurst.

Turning a Bible study into a habit means it will actually happen. We really only need 3 things for a solid Bible study:

1. A Bible
2. Time set aside
3. The will to get started

When we expect to “just read” each day, it’s not easy to make it a habit, but if we use a plan—especially one we can “check off” each day—we’re more likely to stay on track.

“Unless we form the habit of going to the Bible in bright moments as well as in trouble, we cannot fully respond to its consolations because we lack equilibrium between light and darkness.”
————Helen Keller (emphasis mine)

Make it a daily practice. Block out the time and study. Don’t just read it without retaining. Get into the Word, write in your Bible, highlight, make notes. I quote Spurgeon again: “A Bible that’s falling apart usually belongs to someone who isn’t.” How true is that? Put in the work. It’s worth it.

Additionally, we need to remember to apply the things we learn to our life. I always begin my Bible study with brief meditation 1, a worship song, prayer, and then reading. I always pray God will help me apply this knowledge and wisdom to live differently and to become more Christlike each day. 

```“Don’t fall into the trap of studying the Bible without doing what it says.” ```


But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.[James 1:22-25](https://prayers.github.io/learning/bible/雅各书.html#雅122)

## 10 bible study plans
### 1. The Bible Project Plan
Each week, in this 365-day plan, you’ll read chapters grouped and organized. In other words, if a certain topic spans three chapters, you’ll read three. If it spans, six, you’ll read six. The coolest thing about this plan is, at the beginning of each book, you’ll watch the Bible Project’s signature explanatory videos. Along with other topical videos throughout.

This plan takes you on a journey through the entire Bible over the course of one year. Each book includes videos specifically designed to enhance your understanding and engagement with God's Word.

### 2. Bible in 90 Days
The complete Bible with a lot of daily reading.  
Yes, this is the entire Old and New Testament is 90 days. The plan says it’s roughly 12 pages a day, which is a commitment to be sure, but not impossible. If you stick with it, you could read the Bible four times throughout next year. That being said, if you’re looking to spend more time on each chapter, consider the next plan.

### 3. Daily New Testament
The New Testament only with minimal daily reading for deep study.  
In contrast to reading the entire Bible four times in a year, as the previous plan allows, in this plan, you will read through only the New Testament, once, over the year. That means you will have a short reading each day — only one chapter. If you’re looking to deep-dive into Jesus’ teaching, this is a good plan for you. There’s a brief devotional explaining each chapter before you read it.
### 4. Chronological Bible Plan
The complete Bible in chronological order.  
The complete Old and New Testament, organized in order of when the events happened, according to the most recent research. You’ll start with Genesis, and quickly get into Job, and then continue on in chronological order throughout the entire Bible. If you’ve always read the Bible in the order the books were canonized (the order they appear in your Bible), consider trying this way for a year.
### 5. Whole Bible in Under Two Years
A slower reading plan for a deeper study.  
### 6. Four Streams Bible Reading Plan
Heavy on the New Testament, still including the Old.  
This is a unique plan created by John Morton and Tom Anderson, members of the Four Streams ministry team, which goes through the New Testament and Proverbs four times, the Psalms twice, and the Old Testament once. It’s heavily focused on the teachings of Jesus, while including the Old Testament teachings too.
### 7. Life Journal Reading Plan
New Testament twice, Old Testament once.  
Similar to the previous plan, you’ll read through the New Testament twice, and the Old Testament once over the year. However, there is a little less reading with this one, since it omits the daily Psalm and you only read Proverbs once.
### 8. The Entire Bible in a Year
A balanced daily reading of the Old and New Testament.  
This reading plan guides you through the entire Bible in one year reading every verse, chapter and book one time. You’ll read from the Old Testament and New Testament everyday and a chapter from Psalms or Proverbs every second day. It’s a balanced way to read the entire Bible in a year.
### 9. 5x5x5 Reading Plan
The New testament in 5 minutes a day, 5 days a week.  
Five minutes a day, five days a week, five ways to dig deeper. In Discipleship Journal’s plan, you’ll read one chapter a day, but only five days a week. It’s great if you are limited on time. It also omits the excuse of not having enough time to read the bible — it only takes five minutes.
### 10. An In-Depth Study of Matthew
A very deep and slow study, starting with Matthew.
### 其他
#### Ninety-Day Challenge
Read the Bible all the way through in only 90 days. It's a challenge well worth taking.
#### One-Year Immersion Plan
With this immersive plan, you'll read the Old Testament once and the New Testament three times each year.
#### Prof. Horner's Reading System
A unique and challenging system where you read 10 chapters a day.
#### Stay-on-Track Plan
If you have trouble staying on track, this one-year plan will help. There are readings only on the weekdays, with weekends free to catch up or get ahead.
#### The Busy-Life Plan
If your life is busy, this plan will help you get through the Bible at a pace that works for you. You’ll read a short selection each day and complete the Bible in two years.
#### The Christmas Bible Reading Plan
Designed for personal or family reading times, these 25 New Testament readings highlight the birth of Jesus and the purpose for His coming. Related Old Testament passages are also featured daily.
#### Thematic
This Bible reading schedule is thematic or connective in nature. The goal is to make as many associations as possible between the different parts of Scripture while still reading individual books of the Bible from start to finish.


## A brief introduction to the Bible
You will notice in the contents that the Bible is divided into two main sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Old Testament has 39 books. The New Testament has 27 books.  
A “testament” is another word for covenant, an agreement established by God setting out the relationship between God and human beings.
### the Old Testament
The contents of the books also vary. In the Old Testament there are books of history about the people that God called, government records, moral and religious law, poetry, songs, and wise sayings.

There were also books written by prophets. Prophets were men chosen by God to deliver his message. They asked people to live in ways pleasing to God. They also looked ahead to the coming of a servant and a king who would save his people. A special word used for this person was the “Messiah,” the one chosen to be king. The last Old Testament prophet wrote his book about 400 years before Jesus lived.

### the New Testament
The New Testament starts out with the Gospel – four books, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, named for the men who wrote them. Gospel means “good news.” The Gospel describes the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christ is the Greek word that means the “Messiah,” the servant king looked for by the prophets of the Old Testament.

The next book in the New Testament, Acts, describes the acts of Jesus’ followers following Jesus’ return to heaven. The other New Testament books are all letters from Jesus’ followers to early Christian churches or other Christians. These letters help us understand the good news of Jesus Christ and how to apply it in our own lives.

**保罗书信**
在新约全书廿七卷中，按保罗十三卷书信之卷数约占全书之半数，书中所论教义真理，至为扼要而精深，故甚为圣经学者所重视，据查考林前五9，林后二4，西四16，帖后三17，各处经文显示，可知保罗另外还写有达哥林多，老底嘉书信，及其他书信，皆未列入新约圣经中，圣经家且有认为希伯来书亦为保罗所著者（参来十三18，19，23，24）。总之，自罗马书至腓利门书，这十三卷书信，确系保罗的著作，这些书信的编排，不是按照时间排列的，乃是按着教义次序编排的，按其要义，可以区分为五类：

+ A、属于教义神学性质者——罗马书、加拉太书为保罗第三次出外布道时写的，皆论因信得救的真理。
+ B、属于教会政治性质者——哥林多前书，为保罗第三次外出布道时写的，辩论治理教会规章。
+ C、属于末日教义性质者——帖撒罗尼迦前后书，为保罗第二次外出传道时写的，预言基督二次荣耀降临，再来之道。
+ D、属于信徒灵性者——以弗所书，腓力比书，歌罗西书，腓利门书，为保罗在罗马监狱所写，论在主里的丰满，又称为监狱书信。
+ E、属于教牧学性质者——提摩太前后书，提多书，腓利门书，为保罗被释放以后及二次坐监时所为，论到教会行政之道，称为教牧书信。

# Daily Bible Reading
## 一些说明
在网上查了很多读经的文章，找到了4-stream方法感觉比较适合我的；我基本采用的是3-stream方法。而且，我在读经的时候，基本是精读，而不是泛读。所以我的一个体会是，精读泛读要结合起来，更能丰富经历神。就好像，福音派强调从悟性层面认识神，灵恩派则从感性层面经历神；两方面都应该有。因此，我决定讲两个方式结合起来，采用“3+1”读经法。脱胎于4-stream方法，3+1读经法更适合我，3-stream精读，1-stream泛读。
